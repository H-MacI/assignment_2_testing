# A9501-assign2

Write one or more bash shell scripts to re-organize the files for a research project according to the “project organization” scheme described in [Wilson et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00037), Section 4. This project can be one that you’re currently working on or have worked on in the past, or a dummy project that will be provided. Moving and re-naming files and directories should use git commands (called from the bash script) to make them reversible.

Your submission for this assignment is a GitHub repository showing the commit history for your development of the script. As you develop the script you will likely need to test it.  _Do this testing in a directory that is outside of your repository_ so that you don't inadvertently create one git repository inside another one, or litter the development history of the script with the git commands that it generates. You should also keep a backup copy of the file structure that your script reorganizes so that you can reset it as you test.
