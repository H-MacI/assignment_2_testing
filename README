*nucCentre.tbl are spectra extracted from 5"x5" box at the
position of the nucleus.

*nucUP.tbl are spectra extracted from 5"x5" box to the North
(where the bright 11.3um feature is)

*sp.tbl are spectra extracted over the full 30"x50" cube.

m31nuc*.fits are the cubes as we got them from STScI. 95% sure these
are the ones that Dimuthu extracted from (although I need to check this).
